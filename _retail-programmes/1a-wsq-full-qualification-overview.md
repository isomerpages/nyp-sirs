<p>The Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) is a national credential system that trains, develops, assesses, and certifies skills and competencies for the Singapore workforce. WSQ offers bite-sized training modules, at the end of which, a Statement of Attainment (SOA) is awarded. Trainees can also accumulate relevant SOAs to achieve WSQ full qualification.</p>
