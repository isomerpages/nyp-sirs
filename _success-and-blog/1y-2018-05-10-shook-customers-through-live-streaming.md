<p>Just last month, Singapore‘s first “网红” (internet celebrity) was borne.  Lerine Yeo, or affectionately known in the online community as the ‘S-hook sales lady” sold 100 
  pieces of “holey” shirts and shot to fame in just a few days, garnering more than 2 million views. She had just demonstrated the huge potential of live streaming.</p>

<p>So how did she do it?</p>

<p>In our recent Alibaba Global Course Series: New Marketing in April 2018, we shared about the new trends in marketing and one of the hot topic was live-streaming, which 
  blends entertainment into e-commerce, giving the buzz word, entertainmerce. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-internet-livestreaming-idUSKBN17E0EV">Chinese Renaissance Securities</a>, in 2016 live-streaming produced revenues of more than 30 billion yuan ($4.3 billion). This figure is to increase by more than 300% by 2020.</p>

<p>What about Singapore? Platforms such as Facebook Live, YouTube Live Streaming, Instagram Live and others are just some avenues you can explore.</p>

<p>Interaction with consumers is the key ingredient for entertainmerce success, allowing customers to interact real-time with the host, akin to chatting with your friends.</p>

<p>SIRS analysed the 3 things Ms Yeo has done right and how you too can apply to your business:</p>

<b>1. Know your audience and relate to them</b>
She uses terms that are very relatable to her Singapore audiences. From her natural Singlish to the everyday life scenarios such as buying “kueh png” (chicken rice) at the 
market and having “no hands to carry”.</p>
 
<p>Identify your target groups based on your product by analysing their age, preferences and shopping habits.</p>
 
<b>2. State the unique selling points of your products</b>
<p>While it was merely a black top with some holes, but she was able to creatively highlight the selling point to her targeted group of female shoppers who have difficulty 
  holding on to the many things bought during shopping.</p>
<p>What pain points do your products solve for your audience? Can you creatively bring out the features of your products? React honestly to your audiences’ feedback and 
questions.</p>
 
<b>3. Create your personal brand</b>
<p>She has established herself as someone candid. Her sense of humour was entertaining and made her audiences feel that it was not just a sales pitch but an entertaining 
  comedy. They can trust her with their honest opinions and feedbacks.</p>
<p>Creating your personal branding allows the right brands to look for you for brand endorsement. Your personal brand also enable your consumers to remember you.</p>
