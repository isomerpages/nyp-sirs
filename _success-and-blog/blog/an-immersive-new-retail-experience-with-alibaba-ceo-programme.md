<p>"The programme structure that combine corporate and site visit with classroom engagement was well designed to allow us to understand Ali corporate culture, business model 
  and understand the "new energy" that is propelling the company ahead of others.</p>

<p>The trainers who are also very experience practitioners in their field have used real case examples and pack their pointers into slides to help us better understand the 
  concept. The whole "willing to share" spirit is really commendable. Finally, the thoughtful ice breaker sessions and having a meal together have created a very memorable 
  time for me and also having acquainted many like-minded friends. Well done SIRS!"</p>

<p>"The Alibaba CEO programme which I attended last week was very informative and eye-opening, that covered all aspects of the course structure brilliantly. Essentially, I 
  like the course ingredients and it really made me think about possible scenarios, particularly on my new business and the elements to make it more commercialized/digitalized
  in my ecosystem.</p>
  
<p>Not only I have developed new insights from the success factors of this giant, but have also adopted diverse views from coursemates of different backgrounds
  and levels during the group discussions. Excellent lecturers, facilitors and organizers, obviously an expert in their field; I liked it that all presenters were very 
  enthusiatic and engaging, with lots of conviction, and they covered a broad range of tips and advices from varying perspectives yet a connected string of common overarching 
  principles, which enable me to draw my visualization closer to the market reality, and to apply practicality to my approach better.</p>
  
  <p>Also, one of the most valuable takeaways is the great deal of friendships made especially the business veterans, and the like-minded peers, through vast networking 
  opportunities. This is a course that is highly recommended to anyone - I am personally very pleased and honoured to be part of the programme, and thanks to SIRS for 
  their tremenduous efforts in putting all these pieces together!"</p>
