<p>Digital Economy 5.0 denotes the breaking down of geographical borders and different sectors through the introduction of modern technology, marking the need for a shift in 
strategies to succeed in the rapidly transforming business landscape.</p>

<p>As of 2018, Alibaba has become the equivalent of the 22nd largest economy in the world and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2097691/alibaba-aims-become-fifth-largest-economy-2036">aims to become the 5th largest global economy by 2036</a>. Speaking to more than 100 
PMEs from NTUC UFLX on 21 May 2019, SIRS Digital Commerce Lead David Lee shared some of his insights to what has made Alibaba such a successful company, and what will propel
them further as they strive towards their 2036 goals.</p>

<p>In his analysis, David identified 5 key points that makes Alibaba a global force to reckon with.</p>

<b>1. Complete online and offline integration</b>
<p>The digitalisation of the economy has resulted in many business owners moving their sales and marketing strategies online, often neglecting the importance of the 
  offline segment. Rather than focusing only on a single aspect of the business, Alibaba instead closes the gap between the online and the offline in what Jack Ma terms 
  as “New Retail”. The concept of New Retail redefines the role of each space in the consumer journey – an online journey that emphasises on interactive, engaging content, 
  an offline journey that focuses on experiential marketing, and a seamless movement between the online and offline spaces. Hema Xiansheng Supermarket, with its seamless 
  integration of technology in the shopping experience, is a perfect showcase for Alibaba's vision of New Retail.</p>
  
<b>2. Seamless, end-to-end logistics</b>
<p>One key challenge that retailers face in moving to an online space is the logistics and fulfilment of goods and services to consumers. The integration of Alibaba’s services 
  with Cainiao, an end-to-end fulfilment service that leverages sophisticated technology such as the Internet of Things (IOT) for automated picking and packing, down to 
  last-mile delivery of orders. Synergising automation and Big Data, Cainiao takes on logistical challenges during the <a href="https://www.alizila.com/cainiao-gears-up-for-2018-11-11/">11.11 Global Shopping Festival</a> with ease, delighting 
  countless end-consumers with the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of order fulfilments.</p>
  
<b>3. Marketing powered by Big Data</b>
<p>With the plethora of available platforms and services under the Alibaba Group, marketing services has become key in ensuring the success of their partners and merchants. 
    Alimama, the marketing arm of Alibaba Group provides a full suite of marketing services, ranging from search marketing, display marketing, and programmatic marketing, 
powered by Big Data to ensure that a brand’s messaging is effectively communicated to the target audience.</p>

<b>4. Payment and financial services</b>
<p>With a valuation of US$150 billion, Ant Financial is China's most valuable financial technology company. Known formerly as Alipay, Ant Financial provides financial services 
  from payment of goods, to loans, insurance, and investments for consumers, integrating the crucial element of a convenient payment gateway to their range of services.</p>
  
<b>5. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies</b>
<p>Finally, all the above is further optimised through cutting edge <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/07/23/the-amazing-ways-chinese-tech-giant-alibaba-uses-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/?sh=69806be117a9">artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities</a>. For instance, through machine 
  learning, Alibaba is able to determine the optimal product listing format for maximum conversion. Artificial intelligence then enables the product listing to be 
  automatically adapted into the individual consumer’s preferred format.</p>

<b>What does this mean to my retail business?</b>
<p>The changes that come along with the transformation of the retail industry may sound daunting, but it also presents an unprecedented opportunity for retailers.</p>
