<h4>An e-Commerce business owner’s journey to become one of the top sellers on Lazada</h4>

<img src="/images/images-2021/SuccessStories-MrKwan.jpg" style="width:70%;">

<p>In Dec 2019, Mr Kwan Kah Huei had to close the educational centre that he had been running since 2006. At 62 years old, he faced difficulties to get a suitable job and decided 
to learn how to start an online business to earn some income. On 23 Oct 2019, Mr Kwan attended his first training programme with SIRS "Getting Started on Lazada (Onboarding)" 
which greatly exceeded his expectation. He thought that the sales he could earn from having an online store at Lazada would only give him a nett income of $50 a day, but on 26 
Feb 2019, he turned out to become one of the top sellers on Lazada. Mr Kwan attributed his success to SIRS training programme, on top of his background in business and accountancy. 
Since his success, he has already asked his friends to join the programme and has also attended "Driving Sales Performance on Lazada (Marketing)" and "Driving Sales Performance on 
Qoo10 (Marketing)".</p>
