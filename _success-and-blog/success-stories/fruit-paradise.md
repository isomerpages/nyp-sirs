<p>The pandemic is forcing many businesses to pivot and find new ways to engage and sell to their customers online. Fruits Paradise, a family-owned business 
with over 40 years of experience selling high quality, in-season fruits is a perfect example of how a local business remained resilient and overcame disruptions in the industry brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Mr Seng Kang Boon, the 56-year-old owner of Fruit Paradise located in Ghim Moh Market, was inspired by the New Retail concepts they were exposed to during a study trip to Hangzhou as part of the <a href="/digital-programmes/alibaba-business-school/alibaba-ceo-programme">SIRS-Alibaba CEO Programme</a>. The owners experimented with new ways to sell online since then, and have continued their learning journey by enrolling in three more digital courses at SIRS. Mr Shen also shared their plans to launch their own brand logo, improve their packaging and engage more customers on Facebook through livestreaming.</p>
