<p>Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, heartland business Unidbox Hardware was already suffering from slow sales. Unidbox recognised the need to explore new areas such 
as e-commerce and despite having an online presence, it was not generating sales and they did not have additional knowledge on how to operate their online business. This 
prompted its director and staff to upskill themselves. Director Wong Hing Kong first signed up for WSQ Diploma in Retail Operations with SIRS. During his training, he sent 
his sales staff to attend SIRS e-commerce workshops to learn how to enhance their online business as none of them was equipped with the skills to transform or create an 
effective online presence.</p>

<p>Since the training, Unidbox saw their store’s sales on Lazada grow 5 times, from around $2,000 a month to $10,000. It also helped the store to 
become an endorsed online seller on Lazada, growing from a level three rating to level seven on the website. “This is a whole new universe for us and one that is opening 
up interesting opportunities,” said Mr Wong. Training has helped Unidbox better understand how to operate the full cycle of an online business, and how to leverage on 
in-platform campaigns and events to increase sales. Mr Wong added that he will continue to send his staff for training so that they can serve customers seamlessly online 
and offline.</p>
