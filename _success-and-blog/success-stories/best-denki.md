<h4>BEST Denki increased sales by 100% within 6 months</h4>

<p>The journey to digital commerce was a challenging one for us. Being a new domain, we did not have the prior knowledge nor resource and are moving into unchartered territory. 
It took some time for us to set up the e-commerce operations in place and digital marketing was also a new area for us. At the start, consumer awareness was low and online 
traffic did not pick up. There was a lot of trial and error.</p>

<p>Thankfully I came across and attended SIRS' Alibaba programmes. It is very enriching to hear from the experts 
and deepen our understanding of what digital commerce is about; that it is not just e-commerce but a whole ecosystem involving the different functions. The O2O integration 
was an eye-opener for me, showing me the opportunities of being a multi-channel retailer. How business transformation is possible when we are ready to embrace change and 
adapt to be future-ready. Within 6 months of attending the programme, after applying what I have learnt, I managed to increase the sales of my department by 100%. I am now 
better equipped to formulate the digital commerce strategies for my company and are more confidently when presenting to my management. Thank you, SIRS, for organising this 
programme.</p>
