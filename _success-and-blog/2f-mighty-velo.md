<h4>Mighty Velo gained deeper understanding on online business model and business patterns</h4>
<img src="/images-2021/SuccessStories-MightyVelo.png" style="width:65%;">

<p>Before attending the Alibaba Business School - SIRS CEO Programme, we had lacked the knowledge and confidence and suffered from inertia. This information-packed 
programme has helped to provide a deeper understanding of the online business model and ever-changing consumer patterns. It seeks to prepare us to have an open mind 
and gives us confidence in trying out different e-commerce platforms. It has also made us new SME friends and we have learnt so much through our week longâ€™s interaction 
with other SME owners who are in other industries. We recommend SME owners who have a working knowledge of Mandarin to attend this useful and eye-opening course before 
embarking on your e-commerce journey and make new friends.</p>
