<p>Before attending the Alibaba Business School - SIRS CEO Programme, we had lacked the knowledge and confidence and suffered from inertia. This information-packed 
programme has helped to provide a deeper understanding of the online business model and ever-changing consumer patterns. It seeks to prepare us to have an open mind 
and gives us confidence in trying out different e-commerce platforms. It has also made us new SME friends and we have learnt so much through our week long’s interaction 
with other SME owners who are in other industries. We recommend SME owners who have a working knowledge of Mandarin to attend this useful and eye-opening course before 
embarking on your e-commerce journey and make new friends.</p>
