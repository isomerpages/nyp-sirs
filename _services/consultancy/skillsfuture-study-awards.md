<h4>What are the SkillsFuture Study Awards?</h4>
<p>The SkillsFuture Study Awards equip Singaporeans with the skills needed to benefit from quality jobs created by our economy. As Singapore continues our 
transition to an innovation-driven economy, new skills and competencies among Singaporeans will be in demand. Jobs are also evolving with new functions and 
existing ones requiring updated skillsets. The SkillsFuture Study Awards encourage Singaporeans to develop and deepen specialist skills needed by future 
economic growth sectors or in areas of demand. It also supports Singaporeans who already have deep specialist skills to develop other competencies. Over 500 
study awards will be available from October 2015. At a later stage, we aim to give up to 2,000 study awards annually. 
	<br><br><b>Update:</b> SSG will discontinue the SkillsFuture Study Awards on 1 April 2022 as part of their broader efforts to review existing schemes and prioritise resources for programmes that deliver stronger manpower development outcomes.
