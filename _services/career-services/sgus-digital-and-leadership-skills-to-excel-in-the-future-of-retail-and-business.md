<br><br>The digital age requires the agility of an organisation and its people to accommodate continuous change. It is about careful planning and putting 
in place initiatives targeting transformational results to bring about benefits of digital transformation, instead of merely adopting systems for 
optimization. In this pathway, participants will learn to evaluate the landscape and develop strategies to bring about digital transformation for 
the business. It is imperative also for leaders to understand the changing social dynamics and behaviours of the workplace in today’s digital age. 
A leader consistently leads others by supporting staff to grow through collaborating and fostering interdependence in pursuing goals that stretch 
their skills. The programmes will equip participants with future leadership skills, to cultivate positive team dynamics, establish clear roles and 
responsibilities, to achieve organisational goals.</p>
