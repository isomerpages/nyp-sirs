CASE and SIRS signed MOU for a new CaseTrust accreditation scheme for online retailers

The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) and NYP-SIRS signed a MOU on 29 Apr for the development of a new CaseTrust accreditation scheme for e-businesses.  The scheme, which will be launched in the second half of 2022, will help customers find reliable online merchants. It will cover the entire range of e-commerce practices from pre-sales to post-sales and address common consumer pain points when shopping online.

Both parties will jointly develop the scheme for e-businesses and its corresponding evaluation framework. It will include CaseTrust requirements such as ethical advertising, price transparency, good sales and after-sales service, as well as business integrity. Retailers who pass this evaluation framework will receive the CaseTrust mark.

NYP-SIRS will assist to develop a one-day workshop to give e-businesses an overview of what the accreditation scheme entails and the corresponding assessment criteria. It will also curate a one-on-one mentorship programme for e-businesses to help them identify and address gaps in the consumer experience they are offering online, before guiding them through the accreditation application process.
