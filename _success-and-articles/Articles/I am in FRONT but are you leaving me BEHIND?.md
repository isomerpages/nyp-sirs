<h4>A Whole New World</h4>

Having borne a big brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic impact, Retailers have seen their fates pendulum at the whims of forces far greater than anything the world has experienced in years. 

Today, as the world opens up moving towards an endemic state, adapting our lives to what many term the “new world”, what is in store for the Retail industry – and what has changed with Retail Frontline workers, who have shouldered the burden of keeping our essentials supplied in the face of unrelenting disruptions and risks?

It is in fact actually a fascinating time for the Retail industry. Despite the massive damage that the pandemic has wreaked on businesses and individuals, it has also forced the world into a level of consciousness in many aspects and at various levels. 
	
Among these was the hugely accelerated digitalisation of businesses on many fronts that would have taken several intensive years to accomplish - and perhaps even much longer for smaller brick-and-mortar retail businesses to acknowledge and buy in to the imperative of digitalisation to transform and risking becoming just another statistic.

However, almost by default, the Covid-19 pandemic has also been attributed with many of the ills facing the Retail industry today: but is the pandemic really the root cause, or has it in reality given the resounding wake-up call that the Retail industry has probably long needed?

Covid-19 threw a harsh spotlight on the importance of integrating digital sales avenues into retail operations, and creating multiple points of sale...<br><small><i><sup>2 Business Times, 21 April 2021</sup></i></small><br>
	
And does answering this call to digitalise spell the end of brick-and-mortar Retail – and for Retail frontline workers – as we know it? 

According to the study and report by Business Times: *“…as Singapore opened up in phases from June 2020…Shopper spending at brick-and-mortar stores resulted in the proportion of online sales falling from above 25 per cent of total retail sales at the peak of the circuit breaker to 12.6 per cent in July.”* <small><i><sup>2 Business Times, 21 April 2021</sup></i></small>
