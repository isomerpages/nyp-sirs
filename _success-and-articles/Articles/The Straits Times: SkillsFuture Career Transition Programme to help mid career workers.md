With rapid advances in technology and industry and economic changes, it is crucial to embrace lifelong learning to stay competitive. Updating your skills can help advance your career and allows you to remain employable in the changing job market. 

Even though the SGUnited Skills (SGUS) programme has ceased from 1 April 2022, a new Train-and-Place scheme, the [SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme (SCTP)](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/sctp#whatisit), has been introduced. The programme by the Ministry of Education has set a target to reach 15,000 workers annually by 2025. 

Similar to the SGUS programme, this new initiative aims to train mid-career individuals, specifically unemployed job seekers and career switchers, with industry-relevant skills to improve employability and pivot to new sectors or job roles in areas such as retail sales and operations, e-commerce, and digital marketing. The SCTP is on a Train-and-Place modality where training providers, such as SIRS, will provide career advisory and assistance to help trainees in their job search. 

SIRS provides [free career guidance](https://www.sirs.edu.sg/services/career-services) for individuals seeking a career in retail and those considering a career change. [Get in touch](https://www.sirs.edu.sg/contact-us) with us, and our friendly career consultants will be happy to assist!
