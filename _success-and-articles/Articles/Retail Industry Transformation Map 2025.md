The Retail ITM was first launched in 2016, comprising a suite of targeted and industry-focused initiatives to accelerate the pace of transformation in the retail sector, including a focus on innovation and the adoption of new technologies to drive productivity, as well as staying agile and responsive to trends in jobs and skills. Since its launch, the retail sector has made good progress in digitalisation and productivity improvements.


<h4>Retail ITM 2025 </h4>
On 7 October 2022, Ms Low Yen Ling, Minister of State for Trade and Industry, launched Singapore’s Industry Transformation Map (ITM) 2025 for the Retail sector.

“The refreshed roadmap will arm the sector with what it needs to meet the accelerated changes brought about by COVID-19,” said Ms Low. 

The updated Retail ITM focuses on strengthening Singapore’s positioning as a global lifestyle and retail hub, anchored with new experiential concepts and innovative products. The Retail ITM will also focus on building a core of global Singapore brands, and uplifting the quality of jobs in the sector.

The quest for unique consumer experiences and a shift towards digital-first business models and omni-channel retail has been precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Coupled with the increase in middle-class consumers in the region, and government and private sector efforts to drive rejuvenation and vibrancy, the retail sector is poised to see further growth and transformation. 

The new Retail ITM 2025 spells out four key strategies which aims to create a vibrant and globally-competitive retail ecosystem for Singaporeans and global consumers.
