<p>Live streaming has grown from a novelty to a necessity, especially since the onset of COVID-19 where many businesses had to act fast in altering their marketing strategies amidst the pandemic.</p>

<p>Ms Janice Chin, director of <a href="http://www.merlingoldsmith.com">Merlin Goldsmith</a>, had started live streaming last year but to further enhance their engagement with customers, they attended SIRS' <a href="/digital-programmes/masterclasses-and-workshops/level-up-customer-engagement-through-live-streaming">‘Level Up Customer Engagement with Live Streaming’ workshop</a> and saw a 10% increase in their sales! Through the workshop, Janice learnt that live streaming involves a lot of techniques to effectively engage with customers and is not just about selling.</p>

<p>Director of SIRS, Megan Ong, shared with Ch8 in this interview that while live-streaming could help brands, it could also be detrimental if not done properly, affecting customers' trust in the brand. This is why participants from our workshop will learn about the entire live streaming process - from scripting and equipment to interacting with customers to better showcase their products.</p>
