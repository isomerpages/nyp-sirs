<p>It is not uncommon for businesses to wrangle various data points in this data-driven era, but have they been effectively processing, analysing, and interpreting the voluminous raw information into usable and actionable knowledge to help them achieve business growth?</p>

<p>Business Intelligence (BI) provides a comprehensive view of a businessâ€™s current state of operations. Through its range of data analytics and visualisation tools, BI translates data into easy-to-digest insights to enable decision-makers to make strategic and informed judgments, helping businesses operate more efficiently and in turn, increase their revenue.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we will introduce various data collection methods and a data analysis process to drive results for your business. Through a hands-on approach, you will experience using Microsoft Power BI to create a dashboard that puts together important analytics at a glance and acquire the ability to make meaningful interpretations from the results generated.</p>
