<p>Our society is transforming in the technological evolution, and every advancement is influencing how businesses attract consumers to buy from them every which way in a fiercely competitive and highly connected market.</p>

<p>Whether you are an established business or looking to start one, the existing media and channels you own are some of the most powerful resources you can leverage to attain significant and sustainable results for your business. With a well-developed owned media strategy, you can drive and maximise tremendous returns organically while having direct control and ownership over your content and brand messaging.</p>

<p>While paid and earned media are vital for a successful holistic marketing model, ramping up the strength of owned media is paramount for your business to enjoy greater reach, improve cost efficiency and achieve a more profitable ROI. Better still, an organically-generated business presence is more effective in instilling consumersâ€™ trust in your business, increasing their willingness to engage with you. Through a series of hands-on development work in this workshop, you will learn to devise an owned media strategy that drives quality leads for you continually for free and which will have higher propensities to convert into sales!</p>
