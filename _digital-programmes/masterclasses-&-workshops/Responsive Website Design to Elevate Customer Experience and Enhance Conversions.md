<p>Websites are where almost every potential and existing customers land to seek information and interact with businesses today. Just like how visual merchandising is integral to the success of a retail store, every detail of an intuitive website, from layout to content, must be logically constructed and aesthetically designed to elevate customer experience and enhance sales and conversion rates. As technology diversifies and customers use various mobile and smart devices to visit websites, it is paramount and valuable for all digital businesses to have a responsive website design.</p>
