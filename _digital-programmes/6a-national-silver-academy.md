<p>The National Silver Academy comprises a network of course providers, providing a wide range of courses to seniors to encourage lifelong learning. Courses under the NSA not only equips seniors with work skills, but also caters to interests in media, design, finance, and more.

Pick up Basic Digital Skills training, a part of the Silver Infocomm Curriculum, to be a tech-savvy senior and stay in the know. All the courses listed include practical hands-on activities tailored to suit the learning pace of seniors and step-by-step guidance will be provided.</p>
