<p>Social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram are permanent companions for most Singaporeans these days as we see 76%* of our population being active users. 
It is a force to be reckoned with and retailers have recognised that and tapping on the potential it brings to their businesses.</p>

<p>However, successful social commerce does not work the same for all businesses. It must be customised to match the brand personality of your business and the lifestyle 
of your target audience. Go where your customers are and learn to reach out to them efficiently and effectively to win their hearts and pockets.</p>

<p>This programme includes 16 hours of classroom learning and 56 hours of on-the-job training where you will be assigned to a personal mentor. At the end of three months, 
you will be able to leverage social commerce to grow your business with confidence!</p>
