<p>First impressions matter in both personal and business aspects and have a profound effect on human behaviours. A well-defined strategy in your store design and layout is crucial in helping you to create a strong and positive first impression. When customers walk past rows of retail stores, an attractive storefront will entice them to visit the store. What they see next as they enter the store is vital in encouraging their interests and buying decisions. Visual merchandising is a critical element of retail marketing. When done correctly, it increases brand awareness, improves customer engagement across platforms, influences buyer decisions and, as a result, boosts ROI and gives customers a reason to patronise again.</p>

<p>In this 16 hours mentorship programme, learn about visual merchandising techniques to rejuvenate your shop premises, enhance customer experience, and improve online-to-offline integration. A unique feature of this programme is that it will be conducted through a 1-on-1 mentoring with a Visual Merchandising Consultant, delivering learning with hands-on sessions to support you in transforming and optimising your retail store's presentation.</p>
