<p>Singapore companies who are keen to kick-start their cross-border online businesses can tap on the Multichannel E-commerce Platform (MEP) Programme to adopt multichannel 
cross-border e-commerce solution.</p>

<p>Through appointed MEP providers, SMEs can manage their cross-border multichannel e-commerce selling with ease. Leveraging on their expertise and strong in-market network, 
SMEs can expand their digital sales channels and access to new customers.</p>

<p>Under this programme, SMEs not only will benefit from tapping on MEP solutions, they will also be equipped with essential skills to operate a successful online business. 
Singapore Institute of Retail Studies (SIRS) is the designated training partner to develop the training programme with MEP providers to help SMEs onboard the providers'
