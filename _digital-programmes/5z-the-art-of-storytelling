<p>A good story is always more persuasive than facts. It is able to attract attention, engage emotions and
influence decisions. For businesses, a good story will help to make selling much easier. Customers today
are bombarded with more advertisements and messages than ever before, so a good story that resonates
with them can draw the attention of your audience, encourage interest and develop an emotional bond
between your customers and your brand.</p>

<p>Leveraging the power of storytelling is a way of conveying your brandâ€™s personality and offering without
being overly promotional, which can go a long way towards building your business. More and more
companies are recognising the impact of writing a good story and creating buzz for their brands. The
more the buzz, the more the awareness. The greater awareness, the higher the probability of being in the
top-of-mind position of your customers when they make purchasing decisions.</p>
