<p>The retail world is constantly evolving at an unprecedented pace. Preparing your business to tackle the
changes ahead involves understanding the needs of your future customers through trend forecasting. SIRS
collaborates with WGSN, the global authority on consumer and design trends, to provide trend analysis
and product merchandising insights to help you curate relevant products and navigate the retail landscape.</p>

<p>This two-day masterclass offers customised modules to guide you in the effective development of
product collections for retail and acquire practical skills and methodologies to capitalise and execute on
market trends. You will gain a comprehensive understanding and implement effective processes from
trend research to product creation at a commercial level and drive innovation and future strategy in your
business by adding another dimension to creativity that people bring to their work. Start speaking the
same trend language as your customers using macro trend forecasts to extract relevant takeaways from
conceptual themes. You will also develop skills to translate global trends to local perspectives, apply
brand and market filters to create a commercially viable product, and pick up the right trends at the right
time.</p>
