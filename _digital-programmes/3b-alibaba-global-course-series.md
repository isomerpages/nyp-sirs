<p>The Alibaba Global Course series (AGCs) was launched in April 2018 with the Alibaba Global Conference, a partnership between the renowned Taobao University and Singapore Institute of Retail Studies (SIRS).</p>

<p>Alibaba has remained at the forefront of innovation through the invention of cutting-edge technology, redefining the retail industry. Coining the term "New Retail", Alibaba founder Jack Ma envisioned the evolution of the retail industry from one that is disparate, to one that is fully integrated with end-to-end solutions, from manufacturing to the end-consumer.</p>

<p>Through the AGCs, participants stand to gain firsthand knowledge from current practitioners of the Alibaba ecosystem and platforms, as well as top trainers from the esteemed Taobao University.</p>
