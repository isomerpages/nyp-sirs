<p>Megan has been in the education and training industry since 2006 with over 25 years of Public and Private sector experience under her belt. Under her strategic leadership, SIRS propelled to being a key training partner with some of the most established global and local companies including Alibaba, Amazon, Lazada, Qoo10 and Shopee. These are collaborations which have played a significant role in contributing to the fast-forwarded digitalisation and transformation of the retail industry, particularly in the e-commerce space. Megan is also keenly focused on supporting SMEs to succeed and thrive, working unceasingly within SIRS, and externally with other key bodies including Heartland Enterprise Centre Singapore and the Federation of Merchants’ Association but to name a few, to deliver training and consultancy solutions as well as career development and mentoring support to both companies and individuals alike.</p>

**Getting to know Megan**<br>When you are strategic but detailed, speedy but careful, energetic but chilled, optimistic but measured, it’s no wonder that Megan is likened to Harry Potter’s Dumbledore by the SIRS’ team – it takes some powerful “magical” ability to juggle and balance all that, be as fiercely loyal &amp; deeply protective of everyone around her as she is, and then running off to beat her friends at a game of netball. Whew!

**Megan ❤ SIRS**
<br><i>“Being in SIRS is being in the 2 industries that I love! Straddling public duty that also supports the retail industry is meaningful and stimulating work, and the positive impact that we are able to make is what drives me and what I find most satisfying.”</i>

<p>James is the man behind the extensive range of training programmes at SIRS where he has spent the last 15 years. His expertise and passion are in adult learning and curriculum development with first-hand experience as a trainer of various programmes. In his Programmes management capacity, James also has oversight of quality assurance as a priority, curating both content and resources to meet the exacting needs of today’s challenging environment for our learners. Prior to SIRS, James’s extensive experience was acquired from key retail management roles in merchandising, marketing and business development.</p>

**Getting to know James**<br>A good book and a good meal – what more can one ask for. James is an avid cook who whips up meals with as much gusto as he whips up learning programmes; and loves nothing more than settling down with any book that catches his whim…which includes an eclectic range, from armchair travel to his secret stash of TinTin comics. And if you are lucky, you may just get an invite to share an inspired, spur-of the-moment meal, and conversation about his many varied interests!


**James ❤ SIRS**
<br><i>“The greatest satisfaction is my ability to impact lives in positive ways where at SIRS we are constantly working to enable opportunities for individuals and companies to remain relevant and valuable through acquiring needed skills and capabilities.”</i>
