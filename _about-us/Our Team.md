<p>Megan has been in the education and training industry since 2006, and with over 25 years of Public and Private sector experience under her belt. Under her strategic leadership, SIRS propelled to being a key training partner with some of the most established global and local companies including Alibaba, Amazon, Lazada, Qoo10 and Shopee. These are collaborations which have played a significant role in contributing to the fast-forwarded digitalisation and transformation of the retail industry, particularly in the e-commerce space. Megan is also keenly focused on supporting SMEs to succeed and thrive, working unceasingly within SIRS, and externally with other key bodies including Heartland Enterprise Centre Singapore and the Federation of Merchants’ Association but to name a few, to deliver training and consultancy solutions as well as career development and mentoring support to both companies and individuals alike.</p>

**Getting to know Megan**<br>When you are strategic but detailed, speedy but careful, energetic but chilled, optimistic but measured, it’s no wonder that Megan is likened to Harry Potter’s Dumbledore by the SIRS’ team – it takes some powerful “magical” ability to juggle and balance all that, be as fiercely loyal & deeply protective of everyone around her as she is, and then running off to beat her friends at a game of netball. Whew!</br>

**Megan ❤ SIRS**<br><i>“Being in SIRS is being in the 2 industries that I love! Straddling public duty that also supports the retail industry is meaningful and stimulating work, and the positive impact that we are able to make is what drives me and what I find most satisfying.”</i></br>

<p>Angie is our retail operations expert, and co-author of several books focusing on excellence in retail operations. Combining this with her extensive experience in retail marketing from the Luxury, Food Service and FMCG sectors, Angie and her team support our learners in identifying their most pressing upskilling needs to excel in or progress from their roles, and even starting their very own business enterprises.</p>

**Getting to know Angie**

Beneath a dimpled smile, and a picture of zen and quiet confidence is an energetic industry veteran unfazed by market turbulence and zealous in helping learners. Always raring to make a difference, Angie keeps up her vitality stepping up in her workouts (and probably never even breaking out in a bead of sweat). 

**Angie ❤ SIRS**

<i>“I enjoy working with every colleague and team at SIRS. Although each comes with a diverse personality and background, we just have this magical tacit agreement when we work together.”</i>

<p>Celeste is a true blue business development professional whose vast experience in start-ups, ecommerce and retail in Asia has lent her a deep understanding of both the goals and challenges of the companies she works with on their strategic training and consultancy needs. An ex-entrepreneur, Celeste also has the added advantage of possessing a broader perspective of the overall organisational structure. This contributes significantly to the value that she brings to businesses in helping them to identify the key needs in strategic areas especially critical in the New Retail Omnichannel environment,  and that also supports extensively the reskilling and upskilling of employees.</p>

**Getting to know Celeste**

“Good things come in small packages.” never rings more true when you meet Celeste. She is tiny but she is the fiery spicy chilli padi that makes you sit up straighter, eyes opened wider, ears stretched longer (ok, we are stretching this a little) – where she really adds that special kind of spice to any conversation and peppered with a good dose of humour.


**Celeste ❤ SIRS**

<i>“Love that SIRS is very practical and down-to-earth in our approach, where all of us work together amazingly with companies and individuals helping them attain their goals and ambitions.”</i>

<p>James is the man behind the extensive range of training programmes at SIRS where he has spent the last 15 years. His expertise and passion are in adult learning and curriculum development with first-hand experience as a trainer of various programmes. In his Programmes management capacity, James also has oversight of quality assurance as a priority, curating both content and resources to meet the exacting needs of today’s challenging environment for our learners. Prior to SIRS, James’s extensive experience was acquired from key retail management roles in merchandising, marketing and business development.</p>

**Getting to know James**

A good book and a good meal – what more can one ask for. James is an avid cook who whips up meals with as much gusto as he whips up learning programmes; and loves nothing more than settling down with any book that catches his whim…which includes an eclectic range, from armchair travel to his secret stash of TinTin comics. And if you are lucky, you may just get an invite to share an inspired, spur-of the-moment meal, and conversation about his many varied interests!


**James ❤ SIRS**

<i>“The greatest satisfaction is my ability to impact lives in positive ways where at SIRS we are constantly working to enable opportunities for individuals and companies to remain relevant and valuable through acquiring needed skills and capabilities.”</i>
