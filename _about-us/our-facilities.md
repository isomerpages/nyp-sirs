<h4>Retail Experiential Hub (REH)</h4>

<p>The Retail Experiential Hub (REH) is a brand-new collaborative space designed for retailers and learners to stay abreast of the latest technological solutions in the industry while providing hands-on experiential learning. It serves as a hub for hosting exciting events, workshops, and seminars. The REH also features our Visual Merchandising Training Space. In partnership with Love, Bonito, SIRS has created a visual merchandising display that brings the principles of our visual merchandising courses to life. This training space enables trainers to lead their teachings with ease while providing learners with the opportunity to apply their newly acquired theoretical knowledge in a practical setting.</p>
